# Unsafe Rust: Modifying Vector Memory Directly

This repository demonstrates a potential issue that can occur when directly manipulating a vector's memory in unsafe Rust. The code modifies the vector's underlying pointer, which can lead to various issues including data races and memory safety violations if not managed carefully.

## Bug Description

The original `bug.rs` code modifies the first element of a vector using its raw pointer.  While this works in simple cases, it violates Rust's memory management guarantees and is not a recommended practice.  Modifying the vector's internal data structure directly through the pointer can cause undefined behavior if the vector's capacity changes, or if other parts of the code access the vector concurrently.

## Bug Solution

The corrected code (`bugSolution.rs`) uses safe Rust methods to modify the vector's elements. This approach avoids the risks associated with directly manipulating memory pointers.
